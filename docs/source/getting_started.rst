Getting Started
===============

Defining Common Folder
-------------
On first launch, user will be asked for to define a **common folder**.

The purpose of this folder is to share the templates and user data between the different users of the application.
Therefore it is important to define a folder that is accessible to all users.

**Common Folder** can changed any time from File Menu -> Settings -> User

Creating Project
----------------

1. In the Tik Manager4 main UI, go to by File Menu -> Create New Project to create a new Tik Manager4 project.
2. Browse to where you want the Project folder live.
3. Define a Project Name
4. Choose a template to start with. These are just presets for sub-project structures and initial metadata.
5. Define the root metadata by enabling available metadatas if needed

.. tip:: 

    The metadatas defined in root will be passed to all sub-projects unless they are overridden. It is a good practice to set the values like fps which will apply to most of the project in the root.
