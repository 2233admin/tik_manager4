Overview
========

**Tik Manager4** is a lightweight, cross-platform asset and project management system designed to streamline project workflows.

Aims to Be Artist-Friendly
--------------------------

In the world of project management, Tik Manager serves as a helpful guide, assisting team members in staying focused on their tasks, no matter how big or small the project is. Without a project manager, artists may find themselves wasting precious time attempting to stay organized, or worse, risking data loss due to disorganization.

Our goal is to create an everyday project manager that is not only easy to install but also a breeze to use across different platforms. Tik Manager requires minimal maintenance, and all database information is neatly contained within project folders. This allows users to effortlessly copy or move entire projects to other network drives or local disks, ensuring seamless collaboration for both small to medium-sized teams and individuals.

Respects Project Requirements
------------------------------

Recognizing that not every project adheres to the same structure, Tik Manager4 offers the flexibility needed to accommodate diverse project needs.

Some projects may be sprawling, requiring a complex structure with hundreds of assets grouped together, shots organized into sequences, and sequences nested within episodes. Conversely, a personal project might consist of a single asset with only model and render categories.

Tik Manager4 effortlessly supports both these scenarios and everything in between, providing a project management solution without introducing unnecessary complexity. Our aim is to keep small projects simple while ensuring flexibility for more intricate and larger endeavors.

Protect and Serve
-----------------

Tik Manager4 serves as a guardian for artists' work with its built-in validation and publish mechanism.

The straightforward, plugin-based extract and validation mechanism empower Technical Directors (TDs) and developers to easily create their own extractors and validations for any Digital Content Creation (DCC) tool.
