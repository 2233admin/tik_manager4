Tik Manager 4 Blender Installation Guide

# Windows Installation:

- Locate the tik_4_init_windows.py file in the tik_manager4/dcc/blender/setup folder.
- Find the Blender User directory on your system.
    - Windows: %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\<BLENDER-VERSION>\

- Create the <BLENDER-USER-DIRECTORY>/scripts/startup folder if it does not exist and copy the tik_4_init.py file into it.
- With a text editor, open the tik_4_init.py file, locate the tik_path = "PATH\\TO\\TIK_MANAGER4\\" line.
Change the path to the tik_manager4 folder to match the location where you installed the tik_manager4 folder.

# Linux & macOS Installation:

For Linux and macOs, pySide2 or PyQt5 needs to be installed to the Blender Python environment.
Essentially, PySide2 can be pip installed to the system Python environment and then copied to the Blender Python environment.
There are detailed instructions on how to do this here:

After PySide2 is installed, the process is similar as for Windows:

- Locate the tik_4_init.py file in the tik_manager4/dcc/blender/setup folder.
- Find the Blender User directory on your system.
    - Linux: /Users/$USER/Library/Application Support/Blender/<BLENDER-VERSION>/
    - macOS: /Users/$USER/Library/Application Support/Blender/<BLENDER-VERSION>/
